## About Me

Hello! My name is Lei Ma. I am currently a Computer Science PhD student and a Research Assistant at WPI. My main research interests focus on analytics of sequential data, including Deep Anomaly Detection on Sequential data (Logs and Multi-variate time series) and Online Query Execution and Optimization for streaming data.

I am fortunate to be advised by **[Prof. Elke Rundensteiner](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/rundenst)**, a leading expert and the founder of Data Science Department. Prof. Rundensteiner's guidance and expertise have been invaluable in shaping my research trajectory and academic growth.

Our research team, the **[Daisy (DAta-Driven Intelligent SYsmtems) Lab](https://daisy.wpi.edu/?_gl=1*1f2aae4*_gcl_au*NDEyMDIyOTk3LjE3MTI4Nzk1Mzk.*_ga*MjIwMTU0Mjk3LjE3MTI4Nzk1Mzk.*_ga_RE35PKQB7J*MTcxODAzODg2NC41LjEuMTcxODAzODkyMC40LjAuMA..)**, consists of a diverse group of talented researchers and students dedicated to advancing various research topics in the data science field, including artificial intelligence, AI explanation and fairness, anomaly detection, etc. We collaborate on various projects, ranging from theoretical foundations to practical applications of data science technologies.

My research interests encompass a range of data mining topics, with a particular focus on sequential data, including time series and log data.

- LLM-and-Retrieval-Based Anomaly Detection
- Deep Log and Time-series Anomaly Detection
- Event Stream Processing
